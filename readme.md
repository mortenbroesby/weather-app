# Weather app

This is a weather app. The intent is to make use of the OpenWeather API https://openweathermap.org/

## Goal:

Search for a city or request the users location in the browser.
Make a page that shows the daily and hourly chart of the weather forecast for this location.

Create one chart to show all of the following:

* Rain amount.
* Temperature.
* Humidity.

Afterwards I want to style it with the correct weather icons.
